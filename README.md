AI-Powered Liveness Face Attendance System
🔹 Project Overview

This project implements a real-time face attendance system with liveness detection using Deep Learning and Computer Vision. It can identify employees/students from a camera feed and verify they are real (not a photo or video) before marking attendance.

Key Goals:

Real-time face recognition

Liveness detection

Scalable API-based architecture

Production-ready deployment (planned Dockerization & batching)

🔹 Features

Detect and recognize faces in real-time using TensorFlow

Ensure liveness detection to prevent spoofing

Fast and efficient inference for multiple users

Ready for API-based service deployment with FastAPI

Optimizations planned: inference batching, threshold tuning, Dockerization

🔹 Technologies Used
Layer	Technology / Library
Deep Learning	TensorFlow, Keras
Computer Vision	OpenCV, NumPy
Backend / API	FastAPI, Uvicorn
Optimization	Inference batching, threshold tuning
Deployment	Docker (planned)
